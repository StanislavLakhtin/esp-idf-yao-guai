    Yao GUAI ILI-9340 G-Library

    Support for several separate devices / screens in one library is antipattern.
    However, ST7789 and ILI-9340 have such a common interaction interface that combining them
    within a common library may make sense.

    This library is a compromise in this matter. The main goal is to ensure the speed of execution and
    the absence of checks on the time of execution.
